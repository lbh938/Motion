They bring positive energy, good vibes and greenery galore into your living space. But as plants are living things themselves, they require energy and care put into them. Doing the bare minimum for your plants will show in how they grow. Going the extra mile to carefully nurture your tropical plants, air plants, orchids or succulents is always worth it in the end when you have luscious healthy greenery filling your rooms, walls, balconies and windows. Investing in a quality houseplant food is the first step to getting there.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Suppleplant - The Roots<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At Suppleplant, we are rooted in the simple ideals of agrarian farm life societies. Back then, folks were able to grow and maintain their crops and plants without the need for harsh and unnatural chemicals. So, why can&rsquo;t we still do that now? We believe that we can.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The ocean itself provides the nutrients that plant so badly need to thrive the way they should, so we sourced our trace minerals directly from deep within the ocean to create products with pure, bio-available, and active minerals. Who needs a lab?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our teams have created the best indoor plant food we&rsquo;ve come across. We think you&rsquo;ll love it, too. These fertilizers will help to grow long-lasting, healthy, and beautiful plants for your home. The very best part? They do no harm and leave no negative eco-footprint. That&rsquo;s how growing should be.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Organic Fertilizers for a Better Environment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Help your houseplants thrive with Suppleplant line of fertilizer for houseplants featuring naturally derived trace minerals that provide nutrients and aid in cell development. Each formula features a custom blend of trace minerals that work with your specific type of house plant to increase its absorption and make it last longer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp; Our Suppleplant formulas supplement the important nutrients found naturally in soil that house plants often can&rsquo;t get enough of in their pot. Oftentimes, companies will formulate their houseplant fertilizer with chemicals that are easier to come by and cheaper to add. The issue is that these chemicals can harm the plants themselves and can contribute to an overall impact on the environment once that soil gets recycled back into the earth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Organic Fertilizers for a Better Plant<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A mineral-rich, natural houseplant fertilizer will keep a cleaner, greener home and environment, but they also get the job done better. At Suppleplant, our house plant fertilizers will provide the best results by providing naturally-occurring ocean minerals such as phosphorus, nitrogen, sulfur and zinc, just to name a few. With plants treated with Suppleplant fertilizer, it&rsquo;s typical to see a larger, more bountiful yield (like flowers, stems, leaves, or vines), a longer lifespan, and a strong resilience to cold, droughts, disease, pests, or even human error such as overwatering.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Trace Minerals?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Some plant owners may think that a little bit of water here and there will adequately take care of their beloved plant children. While that may be true for some resilient and flexible plants, most need a little extra. To that point, even if your plant is surviving alright on just water, it probably would love some more minerals in its life. This is where an indoor plant fertilizer with trace minerals come into play.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Trace minerals are inorganic nutrients that support biological functions. Each mineral serves a different purpose but each is equally important. Let&rsquo;s take a look at five of the key minerals included in Suppleplant to get an idea of how they support your indoor plant&rsquo;s health.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Trace Minerals<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nitrogen<\/strong>: Nitrogen is a kind of super protein for plants. It is a major component of amino acids, which are what protein is comprised of. So, without trace elements of nitrogen in the soil, a plant will wither away and die.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Potassium:<\/strong> Potassium plays many roles. It helps regulate the intake of CO2, triggers essential chemical plant processes, uptake of water through roots, aids in reproduction and improves drought resistance. This mineral is often considered the &ldquo;quality nutrient,&rdquo; as it is only second to nitrogen in importance and it contributes to size, color, shape, and other common benchmarks used to measure the health of a plant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Iron:<\/strong> Iron is key in helping a plant produce chlorophyll, which is how a plant receives oxygen and maintains its luscious green coloring. Without iron, a plant may look sickly and yellow. It also helps to produce energy to keep a plant looking lively.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Phosphorus:<\/strong> Phosphorous plays a big role in respiration, energy storage, and photosynthesis. Getting down to the basics, it aids in cell growth, division and expansion which help the plant mature and carry out all of its necessary processes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Zinc:<\/strong> Zinc is a big player in enzymes and amino acids. It&rsquo;s one of the necessary nutrients for plants but it must exist in the soil only in small amounts or it will do more harm than good. Using a Suppleplant formula featuring zinc is the best idea because it already contains the perfect balance of the mineral.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Suppleplant for Airplants<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Airplants have adapted themselves to be able to thrive in difficult environments, evolving to the point where they are able to store moisture and nutrients without the help of any soil or rooted home at all. While they are durable and withstanding plants, they still require a balance of air, moisture, and nutrients to thrive. Airplants especially crave nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. Airplant care is tricky, though, because they don&rsquo;t have any soil to absorb the nutrients, so normal plant fertilizers won&rsquo;t work.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for the best indoor plant food for your airplant, Suppleplant for Airplants is your answer. Our spray fertilizer provides a water-soluble and pre-mixed concoction of the most important trace minerals for the overall health of your most beloved airplant. The spray will enhance your plant&rsquo;s strength and vitality by working with the plant&rsquo;s internal structure to increase nutrient absorption naturally.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Suppleplant for Tropical<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tropical plants are complex, but have adapted to growth indoors. That means you can bring their exotic beauty indoors and watch them thrive just as much as they did outdoors. However, their complex nature lends itself to a specific care regimen needed to keep them healthy. For example, they prefer their soil moist, but if it&rsquo;s too wet they will drown. They crave humidity and can become dry if not misted. They are also sensitive to light but need it at a certain level to survive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Feeding tropical plants is also complex. Most tropical plants need the nutrients during the spring and summer months but can survive without them during the winter. They are highly sensitive to chemical fertilizers. Using a chemical fertilizer just once on these precious plants can cause irreversible burning. Suppleplant for Tropicals is gentle enough while still penetrating into the internal structures of the plant to allow for more absorption and higher resilience. The concoction was specifically formulated for finicky tropical plants and will serve them well through the warmer months.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Suppleplant for Orchids<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Orchid care is tricky, as they are famously delicate plants that need just the right kind of care. Different from other common houseplants, orchids require a much higher concentration of micronutrients and trace minerals to support their well-being. While it needs a high amount of these nutrients, using a conventional fertilizer can kill the plant through overdose.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Suppleplant Orchid is the only organic orchid plant food specifically formulated to provide the right delicate balance of nutrients that orchids need. Spraying Suppleplant Orchid liberally on the plant, flowers, and surface of the soil will result in fast results and a happy plant. We&rsquo;ve created Suppleplant Orchid to be the best high concentration orchid food that is not only easy to use, but also fully natural and non-toxic to you, the plant, and the environment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Suppleplant for Succulents<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Succulents are known to be an easy plant to take care of. They&rsquo;re often suggested to new plant owners as a good place to start. But, all too often succulents are killed in the home by those who don&rsquo;t realize they still need their own regular dose of succulent food in order to thrive. Contrary to popular belief, succulents and cacti actually need minerals more than other plants. Because they originate in dry and arid climates, the soil is very nutrient-dense to provide all it needs to beat the tough climate. It&rsquo;s important to replicate this kind of soil for succulent house plants by using a high-quality and natural succulent food regularly. The best fertilizer for succulents is one that is made of organic ingredients that mimic the natural soil succulents are used to. Suppleplant for Succulents is the best fertilizer for succulents as it is designed specifically for hard to feed cacti. It is modeled after natural soil and works with the plant&rsquo;s internal structure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Suppleplant for the Long Run<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Putting a little bit of thought into your house plant food will be worth it in the long run. Our all-natural, nutrient-rich formulations derived from the ocean will treat your house plants with the care they need.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["1502035793746-0"],"settings":{"divider":false}},"1519772126916":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/4.jpg","subtitle":"","title":"Orchid","text":"<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Orchid care is tricky, as they are famously delicate plants that need just the right kind of care.
